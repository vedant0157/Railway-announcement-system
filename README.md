 The Problem which we overcome: Currently railway using traditional meathod for announcement like simply "I am vedant" in this every word like "I", "am", "Vedant" all are recorded seperately and then stored in database and at the time of recording the announcemnet all the recordings are retrived from databsed then arrange them into a queue and then play it serially. 
 Insted of that our software generate the recording on realtime by just taking 3 inputs (Train no, Platform no, time) just by this three input the software announce the statement into three diffrent language (English, Hindi, State Local language).

 Real-time automated translation was implemented in place of importing recordings to cut down on delays and increase efficiency.
 Overcame Language Barriers: Using automated translation, a multilingual railway announcement system was created to enable coherent communication for a diverse passenger base without requiring the importation of recordings from a database.
 our software announce like a real human; no AI tendency voice.
 Realtime generation of MP3 file so no need of storing the audio files in database.
